                <h2>Welcome to Pebble Codes!</h2>
                <h3>Currently Under Construction</h3>
			    <h3>Mark Stone</h3>
			    <h3>Software Engineer Student</h3>
                  
                <p>I am currently studying Software Engineering at Oregon Tech with an 
                    anticipated graduation date of July 2022. I have loved technology for most
                     of my life and have been working with it since a very young age.
                </p>
                  
                <p>I am mostly knowledgable in C++, however I have programmed in Python, 
                    Bash, and a little bit of Java. Most of my projects are programmed in C++, 
                    as I am most comfortable with that language. You will be able to see some 
                    of my past <a href="/projects">projects</a> in the Projects tab. Some of my projects include a full 
                    rewrite of Tetris (written in C++ for one of my classes) and a Word 
                    Scramble game.
                </p>
                  
                <p>In my free time outside of work and school, I am usually working on some 
                    of my projects, my car, playing games on my computer, or doing <a href="/photos">photography</a>. 
                    I usually take pictures of my car or nature, which can be seen in the 
                    Photography tab, or my <a href="https://instagram.com/pebblebrz/">instagram</a>.
                </p>
                
                <p>If you have any questions, please let me know by going to the contact tab, or click 
                    <a href="/contact">here</a> and send me your question! 
                </p>
