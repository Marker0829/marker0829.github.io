        <h1>Pebble Codes</h1>

        <p>I am currently studying Software Engineering at Oregon Tech with an 
            anticipated graduation date of July 2022. I have loved technology for most
             of my life and have been working with it since a very young age.
        </p>

        <p>I am mostly knowledgable in C++, however I have programmed in Python, 
            Bash, and a little bit of Java. Most of my projects are programmed in C++, 
            as I am most comfortable with that language. You will be able to see some 
            of my past <a href="/projects">projects</a> in the Projects tab. Some of my projects include a full 
            rewrite of Tetris (written in C++ for one of my classes) and a Word 
            Scramble game.
        </p>

        <p>In my free time outside of work and school, I am usually working on some 
            of my projects, my car, playing games on my computer, or doing <a href="/photos">photography</a>. 
            I usually take pictures of my car or nature, which can be seen in the 
            Photography tab, or my <a href="https://instagram.com/pebblebrz/">instagram</a>.
        </p>

        <p>If you have any questions, please let me know by going to the contact tab (or click 
            <a href="/contact">here</a>!) and send me your question!
